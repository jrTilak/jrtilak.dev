          I'm a curiosity-driven developer with over 2 years of expertise in building robust web
          applications using the MERN stack and Next.js. ðŸ’» My hands-on experience extends to Docker
          and cloud deployment on AWS, allowing me to deliver high-quality solutions that meet
          diverse needs. As a firm believer in the power of continuous improvement, I resonate with
          the quote: "The only way to do great work is to love what you do." â€” Steve Jobs. This
          passion drives me to participate in hackathons, share insights through blogging, and
          create meaningful user experiences that extend beyond just writing code. ðŸ“š "Code is like
          humor. When you have to explain it, it's bad." â€” Cory House.
