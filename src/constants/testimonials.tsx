        Tilak has been an invaluable asset to our team. He consistently demonstrated proficiency in
        developing web applications from scratch to production. His ability to lead the team
        independently, assist fellow members, and meet tight deadlines has been impressive. When
        Tilak is part of the team, we can always rely on him to accelerate the development process.
        <br />
        In addition to his technical expertise, Tilak proactively offers suggestions to improve
        tasks and takes ownership of completing them as much as possible. He consistently revisits
        his work to optimize and refactor it, ensuring it aligns with best practices and enhances
        overall code quality.
        <br />
        Tilak, I wish you continued success in all your future endeavors. Strive for the top 1% in
        everything you do.
        <br />
        All the best👍

        Tilak Thapa is a skilled full-stack developer who I had the pleasure of working with on the
        ACES web project. His expertise in both frontend technologies (Next.js, Tailwind CSS) and
        backend development (API design, database interactions) was invaluable in building a robust
        and scalable platform. Tilak&apos;s ability to see the big picture and contribute
        effectively to all aspects of the project made him a valuable asset to the team. I highly
        recommend him for any full-stack development role.

        development, particularly with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js).
        He consistently delivers clean, scalable code and has a keen eye for creating user-friendly
        interfaces. His curiosity drives him to explore new technologies, and his adaptability
        allows him to quickly adjust to evolving project needs. Tilak&apos;s collaborative approach,
        problem-solving skills, and attention to detail make him a valuable asset to any team. I
        highly recommend him for any web development role.

        I&apos;ve had the pleasure of working with Tilak on a private project, and I can&apos;t say
        enough good things about him. His ability to take Figma designs and turn them into
        beautifully functional code is truly something special. It&apos;s like watching an artist at
        work.
        <br />
        Tilak pays incredible attention to detail and always strives for the highest quality in his
        work. What really sets him apart is his creativity. He doesn&apos;t just follow the design;
        he brings it to life in a way that feels seamless and intuitive for users.
        <br />
        Beyond his technical skills, Tilak is a fantastic collaborator. He&apos;s always open to
        feedback, quick to solve problems, and great at communicating with the team. Working with
        him has been a fantastic experience, and any team would be lucky to have him.
        <br />
        If you need someone who can bridge the gap between design and code with a touch of artistry,
        Tilak is your go-to person.
